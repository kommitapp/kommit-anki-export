# Kommit Anki Export

This addon exports Anki card text only (no media), and statistics that can be represented in Kommit.

After installing the addon, go to File, Export, and then choose 'Kommit JSON' as the format from the dropdown. You can select which deck to export, and Anki will ask you where to store the file.

Note: The export will say '0 cards exported' but this expected. I haven't counted the cards yet.
