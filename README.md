# Kommit Anki Export

This addon exports Anki card text only (no media), and statistics that can be represented in Kommit.

After installing the addon, you can export a deck from the 'File' menu by selecting the Export item. Choose 'Kommit JSON' as the export format, select which decks you want to export, and Anki will ask you where you want to store the file.

The export will say '0 cards exported' but this expected. I haven't counted the cards yet.
